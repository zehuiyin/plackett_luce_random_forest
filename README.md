# plforest

The plforest function uses the pltree function from the PlackettLuce R package to create a random forest based on bootstrapping and k-fold cross-validation. It takes a ranking class as the response variable and a covariate dataframe as the predictor variable. It predicts the preferred ranking of individuals for a set of objects.
